# Machine Learning Projects
Here, I am describing some of the python projects that I have done. The projects have been performed inspired by the courses that I took or my personal intersts. 
Four projects are included from which three of them have been completed and I am still working on one of them. 

  * :chart_with_upwards_trend: [Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/182e3699aef0d3d26b58c7990478ec9fb6c857d7/Statistical%20Analysis/Statistical%20Analysis.ipynb) (completed): 
      
      In this project, I am presenting part of statistical analysis that I did for my Ph.D. prject. I am analyzing the properties of one of the human organ (prostate gland) to see which of them is being affected by the cancer. For this purpose, I am finding the **statistics of the data** and calculate **confidence intervals**; then, I try to find the effective properties (on cancer) by defining **alternative hypotheses** and find the **t-score and p-values** for each hypothesis. The properties with low p-value are then introduced as those that will be afffected by cancer. (this project is part of my Ph.D. project and so I removed the parts that I am not yet able to publicly share)   
      

  * :chart: [Bank Stock Market](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/016d47925324a5e1714614c3592f54bab88cb5ab/Bank%20Stock%20Market/Bank%20Stock%20After%20Covid%20.ipynb) (completed): 
      
      In this project, I am comparing the performance of six large US bank stock after the pandemic (from Jan 2020 - Dec 2021) and try to explore how they recovered. After processing data, I have **concluded** that:
 
    * Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley have similiar performance (correlation > 90%) 
    * Bank of America (BAC) has a solid and low-risk perfomace but its return might not be always maximum; it is an appropriate stock for long-term investors
    * Wells Fargo is also shown to be a good second choice as its perfomance is different with that of Bank of America and causes more diverse portfolio
    * CitiGroup is a good choice for short-time traders: it can provide high gains but it is a high-risk investment and it can also lead to high losses

    *Disclaimer: I am not expert in stock (I atually have little knowledge in the field), the conclusions are not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.*
    
    
 * :telephone_receiver: [911 Calls](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/016d47925324a5e1714614c3592f54bab88cb5ab/911%20Calls%20(Capstone%20Project)/911%20Calls%20(Capstone%20Project).ipynb) (completed): 
      
      In this project, I am analyzing 911 call received by Montgomery County, PA, from Dec 2015 - Aug 2016 and try to understnad why and when people are commonly call 911. Here are the **conclusions**:

    * Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Traffic (like car accident), and Fire are respectively the most common reasons people are calling 911. 
    * There is no significant difference between the number of EMS and Fire calls received from a day to day, but Sundays and Saturdays show lower number of Traffic calls.
    * Dec shows relatively lower number of 911 calls compared to other months. 
    * Most of the calls are received from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM and it is almost indepenet of the month and day.

* :globe_with_meridians: [Amazon Web Scaping](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/37792adc18700fac596ed54ea407afd143dd8ef5/Website%20Scraping/Amazon/Amazon%20Scraping.ipynb) (completed): 
    
    In this project, I am presenting a program for deriving the production info from the first seven pages of Amazon after searching a custom keyword. The results include 
    
    * Product Title
    * Price
    * Number of Reviews
    * Review Rating
    * Url address

* :large_blue_diamond: [Predicting Diamond Price](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/46277ecc58503aac627bd7b8324f323173c4108d/Diamond/Diamond.ipynb) (completed): 
      
   In this project, I make a linear model for predicting the diamond's price based on its carate, clarity, color, and cut. Including the data with more than 50,000 rows, I trained the model by using 0.5% of the population (training population) and then test the model using the rest to verify the model's accuracy. The model shows >80% accurracy (in terms of R-squared).   


* :movie_camera: [Movie Industry](https://github.com/HamedHeli/PythonProjects/blob/a33ce30fafd909651f29d5ed2a271c7410014c4a/Factors%20of%20Earning%20in%20Movies%20(Correlation)/Factors%20of%20Earning%20in%20Movies.ipynb) (in progress): 
    
    In this project, I am investigating the factors that contribute to a movie's success. This project is in porgress...
